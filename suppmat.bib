  abstract = {A simplified method to compute \$\$R\_t\$\$, the effective reproduction number, is presented. The method relates the value of \$\$R\_t\$\$to the estimation of the doubling time performed with a local exponential fit. The condition \$R\_t=1\$\$corresponds to a growth rate equal to zero or equivalently an infinite doubling time. Different assumptions on the probability distribution of the generation time are considered. A simple analytical solution is presented in case the generation time follows a gamma distribution.},

  abstract = {We analyzed the first 255 PCR-confirmed cases of monkeypox occurred in Italy in 2022. Preliminary estimates indicate: mean incubation period of 9.1 days (95\%CI of the mean: 6.5-10.9); mean generation time of 12.5 days (95\%CI of the mean: 7.5-17.3); reproduction number in the MSM community of 2.43 (95\%CI: 1.82-3.26).},
